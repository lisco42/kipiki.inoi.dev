# Welcome to Kipiki

This site has various bits of projects and knowledge that I'd like to keep out on the internet for my, and hopefully your, usage!  Enjoy!

I carry no responbility on the safety of your builds, or on any dangerous things you may do with the knowledge or having done the projects poorly or having failures of hardware/software/wetware.
