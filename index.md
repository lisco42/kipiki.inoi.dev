# Welcome to Kipiki

!! The old kipiki (mediawiki) had issues where the hosted front-end stopped updating their certs, and I couldnt get the folks to update them for a few weeks so the rebuild-site is live now, its still WIP, but all the content from the old site will transition over, sorry for the dust !!
